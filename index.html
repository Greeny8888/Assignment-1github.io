<h3>Background information<h3>
Hello everyone welcome to my profile
I was born in and raised in Melbourne im the oldest of three siblings. <br>
I left school at the end of year 11 wasn’t really my thing did a few tafe
courses over the years after I left high school.<br>
then started working at hungry jacks and that is where I have been for <br>
the past 14 years started
off as crew and worked my way up to 2ic.
A few hobbies I like to do is play video games on the ps5 also<br>
collect model cars the 1.18 scale ones classic cars unique ones that have a limited
number of ones built so the rare they are thars one thing I look for <br>
also Lego been a big fan of Lego since I was 10 years old I got a <br>
 pretty big collection of unopened undamaged
sets all nicely put away. I have 3 very cute cats that keep me busy after work most of the time
<P>


<h4>Interest in IT</h4>
<p> my interest in it started when i wanted to build my a computer prob when I was 15-16 years old, <b>
 I was woriing at the time saving my money to build myself a really good computer.
 Once I saved enough, I was able tp buy all the parts and work how to put <br>
 it together and get it working. Since then I have always been interested in IT even at work
 when hospitaly doesn’t really have much IT going in it I was still able to <br>
 trouble shot things at work remap a router to have the same vales as the old one. Most of
 my experience is mostly hands on the things I have learnt along the way <br>
 in my yeas of working and getting taught how to fix or trouble shot problems along the day to day work.
