Background information
Hello everyone welcome to my profile
I was born in and raised in Melbourne im the oldest of three siblings. I left school at the end of year 11 wasnâ€™t really my thing did a few tafe courses over the years after I left high school. Then started working at hungry jacks and that is where I have been for the past 14 years started off as crew and worked my way up to 2ic.
A few hobbies I like to do is play video games on the ps5 also collect model cars the 1.18 scale ones classic cars unique ones that have a limited number of ones built so the rare they are thars one thing I look for also Lego been a big fan of Lego since I was 10 years old I got a pretty big collection of unopened undamaged sets all nicely put away. I have 3 very cute cats that keep me busy after work most of the time
