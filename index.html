Background information
Hello everyone welcome to my profile
I was born in and raised in Melbourne im the oldest of three siblings. I left school at the end of year 11 wasn’t really my thing did a few tafe
courses over the years after I left high school. Then started working at hungry jacks and that is where I have been for the past 14 years started
off as crew and worked my way up to 2ic.
A few hobbies I like to do is play video games on the ps5 also collect model cars the 1.18 scale ones classic cars unique ones that have a limited
number of ones built so the rare they are thars one thing I look for also Lego been a big fan of Lego since I was 10 years old I got a pretty big collection of unopened undamaged
sets all nicely put away. I have 3 very cute cats that keep me busy after work most of the time
<P>


<h2>interest in IT</h2>
<p>What is your  interest in it?
It all started when I had to build myself a computer prob when I was 15-16 years old I was woriing at the time saving my money to build myself a really good computer.
 Once I saved enough, I was able tp buy all the parts and work how to put it together and get it working. Since then I have always been interested in IT even at work
 when hospitaly doesn’t really have much IT going in it I was still able to trouble shot things at work remap a router to have the same vales as the old one. Most of
 my experience is mostly hands on the things I have learnt along the way in my yeas of working and getting taught how to fix or trouble shot problems along the day to day work.
